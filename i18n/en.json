      "$1":"Bruno Aubert is the president of Solecooler. He is a graduate of ENSCI and has been an expert in innovation for 38 years. After 13 years of developing new waste treatment processes in the nuclear industry, he created Occigerm in 1996 to industrialize an innovative medical waste disinfection process that he sold all over the world (US Navy, Hitachi Medical, French Navy...). He then worked as a consultant for large groups such as Bekaert to develop a bio-aerosol filtration process in hospitals, and then co-founded Occipol and then EM Research Lab to develop a process for extracting metals (heavy, precious...) without effluents. In 2006 he created Cairpol to industrialize a new miniature air pollution sensor that is widely used in the world (USA, Mexico, Chile, Korea, Japan...) for monitoring, in autonomous and wireless networks, sensitive sites of waste treatment centers (Véolia, Suez, Degremont, NASA, EPA, Total...). In 2019, he created Solecooler to develop a thermo-regulated sole with the sole mechanical energy of our own steps and without carbon footprint."
